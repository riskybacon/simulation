Implementation of Lattice Boltzman Water waves, as describe in the paper:

   R. Geist, C. Corsi, J. Tessendorf, J. Westall.
   Lattice-Boltzmann Water Waves 
   In ISVC '10

Initial conditions implemented as described in
   J. Tessendorf
   Simulating Ocean Water
   SIGGRAPH 2001


To run the project:

Open a terminal window, cd to the directory that contains
the source code for this project

Assuming that your current working directory is the one that
contains the source code:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./lb_waves

Controls:

Mouse:

Left mouse button drag rotates the model
Vertical swiping on the mouse zooms in and out

Keyboard:

C - resets camera position
B - resets simulation to initial conditions, which is a sum of both
    the Guassian and Phillips. These are the interesting initial
    conditions
G - resets simulation to 4 gaussian distributed heights
P - resets simulation to the Phillips specture
R - reloads shaders. This allows for the shader and computational 
    programs to be changed on the fly.
S - Takes a screenshot, saves in PPM format
Space - pauses simulation
