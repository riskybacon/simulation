OpenGL-based simulations

gpu_ps_comparison/
  A comparison of three OpenGL, GPU-based techniques for updating a gravity
  simulation. Vertex texture fetch, copy to PBO, and transform feedback
  buffer methods are compared and measured

ios6/
  The same gravity simulation as in gpu_ps_comparison, but ported to ios6

lb_waves/
  Implementation of Lattice-Boltzmann water waves using an OpenGL fragment
  shader.
